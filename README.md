# HackDTech2021

### This repository contains the code created as part of the Duke DTech HackDTech2021 hackathon for the team Bilingual Bros.

### Our project is part of the "Duke and College Students" track, which attempts to address problems that Duke students face in their lives as students and individuals.

### Often times students recive their dorm assignment in for the coming school year during the previous spring semester; however, there is limited information on the configuration and look of most Duke dorm rooms. While students living on West campus can view the floor plans, it can be difficult to plan which belongings to pack for the school year without a visual of the living space. Most dorms have just one or two images of rooms, which are not always a good indicator of every room in that dorm.

### We have envisioned a website that allows students to view their dorm room for the upcoming school year. Current students will submit photos and some information, such as flooring style and occupancy number, of their current dorm room. Incoming and current students can specify their upcoming housing assignment.  Our solution will match the images and information we collect from a past occupant to the student who will be living in the same dorm room in the future. We also propose a way to safely contact the previous occupant of a student's upcoming room to further discuss the living logistics. In addition, we propose a "similar rooms" option that will allow students to view nearby rooms in their future dorm, in the case that the past occupants of their room have not uploaded a picture.

### Our team hopes to fill the information gap between Duke students' living arrangements from year to year through this project.
